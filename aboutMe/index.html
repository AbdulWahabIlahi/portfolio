        <p>Hey, I break problems (and Raspberry Pis) for fun.
(btw, my first "computer" was a Pi 4 running Kali Linux. Debugging kernel panics at 3AM taught me to love coding's beautiful chaos.)

I'm a curious tinkerer obsessed with AI/ML puzzles and backend challenges. Give me Python, JavaScript, or a RAG system that hallucinates just enough to keep things spicy—I'll turn it into something functional.

Recent Wins:

    Built a video-to-product page converter with a custom AI model (no API shortcuts—pure grit).

    Created MindfulMe: A journal that analyzes voice/text/image entries, spots mood patterns, and chats back with sarcastic wisdom (or sends cat stickers during existential crises).

    Designed chatbots that learn mid-convo and generate memes/images matching emotional vibes (yes, even that "I-hate-Mondays" dinosaur).

Tech I Breathe:
Python LangChain AI Agents Express.js RAG — plus wrangling Puppeteer to scrape the unscrapable.

Current Obsessions:
Breaking AI agents into MCP servers (Westworld vibes?) and making A2A protocols less soul-crushing. Dreaming of multimodal AI that doesn't require 12 coffee breaks to train.

My Code Philosophy:
"Perfect is boring. Ship first, refactor while the world burns." (Except backends—those get my inner perfectionist.) I thrive solo, where tabs-vs-spaces debates die at my door.

Side Projects = Lifeblood:
Most of my tools are "good enough for now, maybe illegal later" experiments. If it works, I ship it; if it breaks, I'll debug it live.

Let's Collaborate If:
You want someone who'll argue about AI ethics and the best Linux distro for a Pi over chai.</p>
